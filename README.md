# Assignment 3 - Master Detail Wine List with Fragments
## Due 11-14-2016
## Author

David Hatten

## Description

Create a master detail application to view the contents of a beverage list.
The master part will display a list of all of the beverage items in the list.
The Detail part will display the details of a specific beverage item.
The User should be able to go up and down items in the list by swiping left or right on a detail page (View Pager).
The App should look like the screen shots I have provided.
There is no need to save any information changed in the application to the CSV file.

The properties of the CSV file are as follows:

1. Item Number
2. Item Description
3. Item Pack Size
4. Item Case Price
5. Whether the item is currently active. This is represented by a string that either says True, or False.

Solution Requirements:

* Master layout (You can use the same layout for both Portrait and Landscape unless you feel the need to make one for each)
* Detail layout (You can use the same layout for both Portrait and Landscape unless you feel the need to make one for each)
* Fragments for all of the layouts (Except ViewPager. That one is a little different.)
* Ability to click on a list item and start a new Activity that displays the details of the list item.
* Updating information in the detail view should be reflected in the list view when returning to the list.
* Class to represent a Beverage Item (POJO)
* ArrayList for the list of Beverage Items
* RecyclerView to display the master view
* Read in CSV file and create ArrayList of Beverage Items from the data in the CSV file
* Use View Pager to swipe left and right on detail page to go up and down in the list
* Should look like the screen shots provided
* Remember Documentation, and README

### Notes

The book does not cover how to read in a CSV file. We will try/plan to do something in class to demonstrate how to get the CSV read in.
You should also do your own research into how to read in a csv file in android
The location of the file to be read in is in the following paths:
Inside Android Studio: app/res/raw/
Through File System:   app/src/main/res/raw/
